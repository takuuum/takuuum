## Overview
As a web application engineer for 3 years, I have participated in 15 projects, covering a wide range of tasks from requirements definition, design, implementation, to testing.

Currently, I am involved in the Application Modernization field, where I support the design and development of migrating systems to cloud-native architectures.

My areas of expertise include application design (DDD, Microservices).
